# GCN-for-Bike-share-system

# Research Question

Can machine learning techniques be utilized to predict the demands for bikes and docks at a bike station? Can the neighbouring bike stations influence the demands prediction for a bike station?

# Objectives

1. Data Transformation of original bike-share data.
2. Data preparation for each machine learning model.
3. Training and optimizing machine learning models; ARIMA, LSTM, STGCN and TAGCN.
4. Evaluation of the models for two-time intervals (30 min and 60 min); RMSE, MSE and MAE
